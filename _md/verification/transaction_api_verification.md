# Transaction Ingestion API Verification

## Specification Requirements (2.1.3.1)

- Endpoint should be implemented as `/v1/transactions`
- Must align with TSMS integration guidelines
- Should validate payloads and store them in the transactions table

## Verification Results

The verification script was run on **May 17, 2025** with the following results:

```

## Verified Components

1. **Route Definition**: `/v1/transactions` endpoint is properly defined in the routes file
2. **Controller Implementation**: `TransactionController` exists in the API/V1 directory
3. **Method Implementation**: The controller includes a proper store/create method
4. **Request Validation**: Input validation is implemented to sanitize and validate payloads
5. **Database Storage**: The controller correctly stores transaction data in the database

## Integration Details

The transaction API endpoint follows the TSMS integration guidelines:

- Uses JWT token-based authentication
- Validates transaction payloads
- Stores validated transactions in the database
- Returns appropriate HTTP status codes and response formats

## How to Test

```bash
# Test the endpoint with a valid payload
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer {YOUR_TOKEN}" \
    -d '{
        "transaction_id": "TX-12345",
        "amount": 100.50,
        "terminal_uid": "TERM-001",
        "timestamp": "2025-05-17T10:30:00Z",
        "items": [
            {
                "name": "Item 1",
                "quantity": 2,
                "price": 25.00
            },
            {
                "name": "Item 2",
                "quantity": 1,
                "price": 50.50
            }
        ]
    }' \
    http://localhost/api/v1/transactions
```
