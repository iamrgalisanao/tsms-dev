# Security Reporting Module - Development Journal

## May 10, 2025 - Initial Implementation & Bug Fixes

### Completed Work

-   Fixed syntax errors in `SecurityAlertManagementService.php` (missing User model import)
-   Improved `SecurityReportExportService.php`:
    -   Added constant for date formatting standardization: `DATE_TIME_FORMAT`
    -   Implemented fallback for PDF generation when DomPDF is not installed
    -   Fixed code style and formatting issues
    -   Optimized the `exportReport` method to reduce return statements
    -   Added proper error logging for PDF generation attempts
    -   Implemented CSV export functionality with proper data formatting

### Technical Decisions

1. Selected DomPDF for PDF generation (via barryvdh/laravel-dompdf) instead of Laravel Snappy
    - Reasons: Better compatibility with Laravel 11, simpler configuration, more active maintenance
2. Used native PHP CSV functions instead of League CSV package
    - Reasons: Reduced dependencies, adequate functionality for our use case

### Next Steps

1. Install DomPDF package and enable PDF generation:
    ```
    composer require barryvdh/laravel-dompdf
    ```
2. Create blade template for PDF reports under `resources/views/reports/security/pdf.blade.php`
3. Implement API endpoints in a controller for the reporting feature
4. Design and implement the frontend UI for report generation and viewing
5. Add unit and integration tests

### Dependencies

-   Currently waiting on the `barryvdh/laravel-dompdf` package installation

### Open Questions

-   Should we implement report caching for frequently requested reports?
-   Do we need to consider background job processing for large reports?
-   What level of customization should be available for report templates?
