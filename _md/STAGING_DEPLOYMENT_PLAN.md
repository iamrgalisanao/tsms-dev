# Staging Deployment Plan

## 1. Pre-Deployment Testing 🔄

-   [ ] Text Format Parser Testing

    -   [ ] Test all supported formats (KEY:VALUE, KEY=VALUE, KEY VALUE)
    -   [ ] Verify error handling for malformed inputs
    -   [ ] Validate field mappings

-   [ ] Transaction Processing Testing
    -   [ ] Verify end-to-end flow with different POS formats
    -   [ ] Test retry mechanism with simulated failures
    -   [ ] Validate circuit breaker functionality
    -   [ ] Check transaction status updates
    -   [ ] Verify queue processing

## 2. Environment Setup ⚙️

-   [ ] Configure staging environment variables

    -   [ ] Database connections
    -   [ ] Redis settings
    -   [ ] Queue worker configuration
    -   [ ] Rate limiting parameters
    -   [ ] Circuit breaker thresholds

-   [ ] Queue Infrastructure
    -   [ ] Set up Horizon on staging
    -   [ ] Configure worker processes
    -   [ ] Set up queue monitoring
    -   [ ] Configure failed job handling

## 3. Data Migration Plan 📋

-   [ ] Run database migrations
-   [ ] Seed required reference data
-   [ ] Set up test terminals
-   [ ] Configure test providers
-   [ ] Prepare test tenant data

## 4. Security Configuration 🔒

-   [ ] Set up JWT authentication
-   [ ] Configure CORS for test terminals
-   [ ] Set rate limiting rules
-   [ ] Configure role-based access
-   [ ] Set up audit logging

## 5. Monitoring Setup 📊

-   [ ] Configure error logging
-   [ ] Set up performance monitoring

-   [ ] Configure circuit breaker monitoring

## 6. Test Cases for Staging 🧪

1. Basic Transaction Flow

    - Submit transactions in different formats
    - Verify processing and status updates
    - Check error handling

2. Load Testing

    - Test with multiple concurrent requests
    - Verify queue processing under load
    - Check system performance

3. Error Scenarios

    - Test retry mechanism
    - Verify circuit breaker activation
    - Check error logging and alerts

4. Integration Testing
    - Test with different POS systems
    - Verify format compatibility
    - Check response handling

## 7. Rollback Plan ⏮️

-   [ ] Database backup strategy
-   [ ] Queue cleanup process
-   [ ] Service restoration steps
-   [ ] Data recovery procedures

## 8. Success Criteria ✅

1. Transaction Processing
