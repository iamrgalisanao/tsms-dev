# TSMS Notification System Design

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: May 28, 2025  
**Status**: Draft - For Review

## 1. Overview

The TSMS Notification System will provide a flexible, multi-channel notification capability to alert users about important system events, transaction statuses, and administrative actions. This document outlines the design and implementation plan for this feature.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Components

-   **Notification Service**: Core service managing notification generation and delivery
-   **Channel Adapters**: Implementations for each delivery channel (Email, SMS, In-app, WebSocket)
-   **Template Engine**: For consistent, customizable notification content
-   **Preference Manager**: Manages user notification preferences
-   **Notification Center UI**: Front-end interface for managing notifications

### 2.2 Database Schema

#### notifications Table

-   `id` - Primary key
-   `user_id` - Target user (nullable for system-wide)
-   `title` - Notification title/heading
-   `content` - Notification body content
-   `type` - Notification category (transaction, system, security)
-   `data` - JSON data specific to notification
-   `priority` - Priority level (critical, high, normal, low)
-   `read_at` - Timestamp when notification was read
-   `created_at` - Timestamp when notification was created
-   `expires_at` - Optional expiration timestamp

#### notification_preferences Table

-   `id` - Primary key
-   `user_id` - User these preferences belong to
-   `notification_type` - Type of notification
-   `channel` - Delivery channel (email, sms, in-app, etc.)
-   `enabled` - Boolean indicating if enabled
-   `frequency` - Delivery frequency preference

#### notification_deliveries Table

-   `id` - Primary key
-   `notification_id` - Foreign key to notifications
-   `channel` - Delivery channel used
-   `status` - Delivery status (pending, sent, failed)
-   `sent_at` - When notification was sent
-   `error` - Error message if delivery failed

## 3. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation

-   Create database migrations and models
-   Implement base notification service
-   Setup event listeners for notification triggering
-   Implement in-app notification storage

### Phase 2: Delivery Channels

-   Email channel adapter
-   In-app notifications
-   Web push notifications
-   WebSocket real-time delivery
-   SMS delivery (via third-party service)

### Phase 3: User Interface

-   Notification center UI component
-   Navbar notification indicator
-   Notification preference management page
-   Real-time notification updates

### Phase 4: Advanced Features

-   Notification grouping and batching
-   Rate limiting and throttling
-   Analytics dashboard for notification metrics
-   Advanced template system
-   Scheduled notifications

## 4. Integration Points

### 4.1 Transaction Processing

-   Send notifications on transaction status changes
-   Alert on validation failures
-   Notify on retry attempts and final outcomes

### 4.2 Circuit Breaker

-   Notify administrators on circuit breaker state changes
-   Alert on service recovery
-   Provide system health notifications

### 4.3 Security Events

-   Login failure notifications
-   Suspicious activity alerts
-   Token expiration warnings

## 5. Technical Specifications

### 5.1 Laravel Implementation

-   Use Laravel's native notification system as foundation
-   Extend with custom channels as needed
-   Leverage Laravel Echo for WebSocket delivery
-   Integrate with existing Redis infrastructure

### 5.2 Frontend Components

-   Vue.js notification components
-   Dropdown notification center
-   Badge counters for unread notifications
-   Toast notifications for real-time alerts

## 6. User Experience Considerations

-   Non-intrusive design for frequent notifications
-   Clear prioritization of critical vs. informational
-   Easy bulk-management of notifications
-   Customizable notification preferences
-   Accessible notification designs

## 7. Testing Strategy

-   Unit tests for notification generation
-   Integration tests for delivery channels
-   UI tests for notification center
-   Performance tests for high-volume scenarios
-   Reliability tests for delivery guarantees

## 8. Metrics and Performance

-   Track notification read rates
-   Monitor delivery success rates
-   Measure notification center usage
-   Track response times to critical notifications
-   Monitor system performance impact of notifications

## 9. Security Considerations

-   Authorization checks for notification access
-   Prevention of notification spam/abuse
-   Rate limiting for external delivery channels
-   Sensitive data handling in notifications
-   Audit trails for notification activities
