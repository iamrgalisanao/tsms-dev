## Documentation Standards

### File Naming Convention
```
{CATEGORY}_{FEATURE_NAME}_{DOCUMENT_TYPE}.md

Examples:
- RATE_LIMITING_VOID_TRANSACTION_FEATURE_SPEC.md
- API_AUTHENTICATION_TECHNICAL_GUIDE.md
- SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT_2025_Q3.md
- DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST_PRODUCTION.md
```

### Document Structure
Each feature specification should include:
1. **Feature Overview** - Executive summary and basic information
2. **Business Requirements** - Objectives and user stories  
3. **Technical Architecture** - System components and implementation
4. **Functional Specifications** - Detailed functionality description
5. **Acceptance Criteria** - Testable requirements with verification status
6. **Dependencies** - System, internal, and configuration dependencies
7. **Security Considerations** - Attack vectors and security features
8. **Performance Specifications** - Response time and scalability requirements
9. **Monitoring & Alerting** - Key metrics and alert thresholds
10. **Testing Strategy** - Test coverage and scenarios
11. **Implementation Status** - Completion tracking and production readiness
12. **Deployment Notes** - Environment setup and configuration
13. **Risk Assessment** - Risk identification and mitigation strategies
14. **Success Metrics** - KPIs and measurement criteria

### Document Maintenance
- **Version Control**: All documents are version controlled with Git
- **Review Cycle**: Quarterly reviews for technical accuracy and relevance
- **Update Process**: All changes must be reviewed and approved by Technical Architecture Team
- **Approval Required**: Feature specifications require formal approval before implementation

## Contributing to Documentation

### Adding New Documentation
1. Create document following naming convention
2. Use established document structure template
3. Include all required sections with appropriate detail level
4. Ensure acceptance criteria are testable and verifiable
5. Map all dependencies completely
6. Include implementation status tracking
7. Submit for technical review before merging

### Updating Existing Documentation
1. Maintain version history in document header
2. Update "Last Reviewed" date
3. Mark any changes in implementation status
4. Update acceptance criteria verification status
5. Refresh dependency mappings if changed
6. Re-validate success metrics and KPIs

### Document Quality Standards
- **Clarity**: Technical concepts explained clearly for all stakeholders
- **Completeness**: All sections filled with appropriate detail
- **Accuracy**: Technical details verified against implementation
- **Consistency**: Consistent formatting and terminology usage
- **Traceability**: Clear links between requirements, implementation, and testing
