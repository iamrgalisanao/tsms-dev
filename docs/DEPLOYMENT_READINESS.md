# Transaction Testing Deployment Readiness

## Ready for Testing âœ…

-   Multiple text format support (KEY:VALUE, KEY=VALUE, KEY VALUE)
-   Transaction validation and processing
-   Status tracking and monitoring
-   Basic error handling and retry mechanism
-   Authentication and security controls

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

1. Environment Setup

    - [ ] Configure Redis for queue management
    - [ ] Set up database with proper indexes
    - [ ] Configure queue workers
    - [ ] Set up proper logging

2. Security Configuration

    - [ ] Configure JWT secrets
    - [ ] Set up rate limiting per terminal
    - [ ] Configure CORS for POS terminals
    - [ ] Set proper authentication timeouts

3. Monitoring Setup
    - [ ] Configure basic alerts
    - [ ] Set up error logging
    - [ ] Enable queue monitoring
    - [ ] Configure circuit breaker thresholds

## Limitations/Risks

1. Performance Testing

    - Load testing not completed
    - Stress testing pending
    - Concurrent processing limits unknown

2. Monitoring

    - Real-time updates not implemented
    - Advanced alerting not available
    - Custom thresholds not configurable

3. Recovery
    - Manual intervention needed for failed transactions
    - Automated retry limits fixed
    - No custom retry strategies per provider

## Recommendation

Can proceed with controlled deployment:

1. Start with limited number of terminals (2-3 per provider)
2. Monitor closely for first 24-48 hours
3. Gradually increase terminal count
4. Keep error threshold low initially
5. Have support team ready for manual intervention
