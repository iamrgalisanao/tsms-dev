# Module 2 Completion Priorities

Based on the Module 2 Core System Development requirements, the following items from our FEATURE_ROADMAP.md should be prioritized:

## 1. Security Implementation (2.1.2)

### Security Reporting (Highest Priority)

-   **Phase 1: Core Reporting Framework**

    -   Database schema for report templates
    -   SecurityReportingService implementation
    -   Basic API endpoints for reports
    -   Report data aggregation logic

-   **Phase 2: Dashboard and Visualization**
    -   Security events overview
    -   Alerts summary visualization
    -   Tenant-specific security metrics
    -   Time-based activity graphs

These align with the 2.1.2.1 (Setup Authentication) and 2.1.2.2 (Configure RBAC) requirements.

## 2. Transaction Logs (POS Transaction Processing - 2.1.3)

-   **API integration for log fetching**
    -   Secure endpoint implementation
    -   Role-based access filters
-   **Pagination implementation**
-   **Advanced filtering system**
-   **Real-time log updates**
-   **Log detail view**
-   **Export functionality**

These align with 2.1.3.1 (Create transaction ingestion API), 2.1.3.3 (Implement job queues), and 2.1.3.4 (Integrate error handling and retry mechanism).

## 3. Testing Infrastructure Improvements (System Testing - 2.1.4)

-   **CI/CD Pipeline Enhancements**
    -   Automated test runs
    -   Security scans
    -   Code quality gates
-   **Performance Testing Suite**

These align with 2.1.4.1 (Write unit and integration tests), 2.1.4.2 (Conduct internal testing), and 2.1.4.3-5 (Deployment and testing).

## 4. Circuit Breaker Dashboard (Error Handling - 2.1.3)

-   **Real-time status monitoring**
    -   Authenticated WebSocket connections
    -   Role-based metric access
-   **Status history tracking**
-   **Alert system implementation**
-   **Manual override controls**
-   **Service health metrics**

These align with 2.1.3.4 (Integrate error handling and retry mechanism).

## 5. Retry History (Error Handling - 2.1.3)

-   **Database schema design**
-   **API endpoint implementation**
-   **UI components development**
-   **Retry analytics**

These align with 2.1.3.4 (Integrate error handling and retry mechanism).

## Implementation Priority Sequence

1. **Security Reporting (Phase 1)** - Critical for security implementation (2.1.2)
2. **Transaction Logs API** - Essential for POS transaction processing (2.1.3)
3. **Testing Infrastructure** - Required for system testing (2.1.4)
4. **Circuit Breaker Dashboard** - Important for error handling (2.1.3)
5. **Security Reporting (Phase 2)** - Complete security implementation
6. **Retry History** - Complete error handling mechanism

This prioritization ensures we complete the core requirements of Module 2 in a logical sequence, with the most critical security and transaction processing components first.
