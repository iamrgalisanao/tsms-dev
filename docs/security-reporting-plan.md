# Security Reporting Implementation Plan

## Overview

The Security Reporting module will provide administrators with comprehensive visibility into security events, alerts, and trends within the TSMS application. It will enable efficient monitoring, analysis, and response to security incidents across all tenants.

## Objectives

1. Provide a visual dashboard for real-time security monitoring
2. Create tools for detailed security event analysis
3. Enable customizable report generation for compliance needs
4. Establish an alert management workflow
5. Support tenant-specific security reporting

## Architecture

### Database Components

-   Use existing `security_events` and `security_alert_rules` tables
-   Add new `security_report_templates` table for custom report formats
-   Add new `security_alert_responses` table to track alert handling

### Backend Services

1. **`SecurityReportingService`**: Core service for report generation and data aggregation
2. **`SecurityDashboardService`**: Service for real-time dashboard metrics
3. **`SecurityAlertManagementService`**: Service for alert workflow management
4. **`SecurityReportExportService`**: Service for generating PDF and CSV exports

### API Endpoints

1. **Security Dashboard Endpoints**:

    - `GET /api/security/dashboard` - Dashboard summary metrics
    - `GET /api/security/dashboard/events-summary` - Events by type and severity
    - `GET /api/security/dashboard/alerts-summary` - Active and resolved alerts

2. **Security Reporting Endpoints**:

    - `GET /api/security/reports` - List available report templates
    - `POST /api/security/reports/generate` - Generate a custom report
    - `GET /api/security/reports/{id}` - Retrieve a specific report
    - `GET /api/security/reports/{id}/export` - Export report as PDF/CSV

3. **Alert Management Endpoints**:
    - `GET /api/security/alerts` - List all security alerts
    - `PUT /api/security/alerts/{id}/acknowledge` - Acknowledge an alert
    - `PUT /api/security/alerts/{id}/resolve` - Mark an alert as resolved
    - `POST /api/security/alerts/{id}/notes` - Add notes to an alert

### Frontend Components

1. **Security Dashboard**:

    - Security overview cards
    - Activity timeline
    - Alert status summary
    - Event type distribution chart

2. **Event Explorer**:

    - Advanced filtering interface
    - Event detail viewer
    - Event correlation view
    - IP geolocation visualization

3. **Report Generator**:

    - Report template selector
    - Custom parameter inputs
    - Report preview
    - Export options

4. **Alert Management**:
    - Alert list with filters
    - Alert detail view
    - Response workflow buttons
    - Response history timeline

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Reporting Framework

1. Create database migrations for new tables
2. Implement the base SecurityReportingService
3. Develop API endpoints for basic report generation
4. Create basic frontend components for viewing reports

### Phase 2: Dashboard and Visualization

1. Implement dashboard metrics calculations
2. Create visualization components (charts, graphs)
3. Develop real-time dashboard updates
4. Add tenant-specific dashboard views

### Phase 3: Advanced Reporting and Export

1. Create report template system
2. Implement PDF and CSV export functionality
3. Add scheduled report generation
4. Develop email delivery for reports

### Phase 4: Alert Management Workflow

1. Implement alert acknowledgement system
2. Add alert resolution tracking
3. Create response documentation features
4. Develop response time metrics

## Technology Stack

-   **Backend**: Laravel 11 PHP Framework
-   **Database**: MySQL with Eloquent ORM
-   **API**: RESTful API with Laravel Resources
-   **PDF Generation**: Laravel Snappy with wkhtmltopdf
-   **CSV Export**: League CSV package
-   **Frontend Visualization**: Chart.js or ApexCharts
-   **Real-time Updates**: Laravel Echo with Pusher

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**:

    - Test each service method for correct calculations
    - Test report generation functions
    - Test data transformation logic

2. **Feature Tests**:

    - Test API endpoints for correct responses
    - Test report generation workflows
    - Test alert management workflows

3. **Integration Tests**:
    - Test interactions between services
    - Test real-time updates
    - Test PDF/CSV generation

## Security Considerations

-   All endpoints should enforce proper authentication
-   Implement tenant isolation for multi-tenant security data
-   Apply appropriate role-based access controls
-   Sanitize and validate all report parameters
-   Add audit logging for report generation and exports

## Required Dependencies

-   Laravel Snappy for PDF generation
-   League CSV for CSV exports
-   Chart.js or ApexCharts for visualizations
-   Laravel Echo and Pusher for real-time updates

## Success Criteria

1. Administrators can view a comprehensive security dashboard
2. Security events can be searched, filtered, and analyzed
3. Custom reports can be generated and exported
4. Alerts can be managed through a defined workflow
5. All features support proper multi-tenant isolation
