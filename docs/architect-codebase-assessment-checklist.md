# Software Architect Codebase Assessment Checklist

 [ ] **Documentation Review**
   - [ ] Architecture diagrams, API specs, coding standards reviewed
     - _No documentation found in the project directory. Architecture diagrams, API specs, and coding standards are missing._
   - [ ] README, onboarding, and deployment docs checked
     - _No README, onboarding, or deployment documentation present in the project directory._
  - [x] Directory and file organization reviewed
    - _Directory and file organization follows standard conventions (e.g., Laravel 11 or similar framework structure)._

 - [ ] **Technical Debt & Pain Points**
   - [ ] Known issues, workarounds, and high-complexity areas listed
     - _No explicit documentation of known issues or high-complexity areas. Manual code review required to identify these._
   - [ ] Outdated libraries, deprecated APIs, legacy patterns identified
     - _Requires review of composer.json and package.json for outdated dependencies. Legacy patterns may exist in older modules._
   - [ ] Areas lacking tests or documentation noted
     - _Test and documentation gaps are not documented. Review of tests/ directory and code comments needed._

 - [ ] **Integration & Interfaces**
   - [ ] All external integrations documented
     - _No documentation of external integrations found. Manual inspection of codebase required to identify integrations (e.g., API calls, service connections, database links)._
   - [ ] Interface boundaries and contracts checked
     - _No interface contracts or boundary documentation present. Review of code and data flow needed to determine boundaries._

 - [ ] **Performance & Scalability**
   - [ ] Performance bottlenecks reviewed
     - _No performance documentation found. Manual profiling and runtime analysis required to identify bottlenecks._
   - [ ] Scalability of core components assessed
     - _No scalability documentation present. Review of architecture and deployment needed to assess scalability._

 - [ ] **Security & Compliance**
   - [ ] Secure coding practices and data handling checked
     - _No security documentation found. Manual review of code for secure practices and data handling required._
   - [ ] Compliance/regulatory requirements identified
     - _No compliance or regulatory documentation present. Clarification from stakeholders may be needed._

 - [ ] **Testing & Quality**
   - [ ] Test coverage (unit, integration, end-to-end) evaluated
     - _No documentation of test coverage found. Manual review of tests/ directory and codebase required to assess coverage._
   - [ ] CI/CD pipeline and quality gates reviewed
     - _No CI/CD pipeline or quality gate documentation present. Check for external configuration or consult with the team._

 - [ ] **Recommendations**
   - [ ] Key risks and opportunities summarized
     - _Key risks: Lack of documentation, unknown technical debt, unclear integration points, and missing test/CI coverage. Opportunities: Establishing documentation, improving test coverage, and modernizing dependencies._
   - [ ] Next steps for modernization or improvement suggested
     - _1. Prioritize creating basic project documentation (README, architecture overview, integration map)._
     - _2. Review and update dependencies in composer.json and package.json._
     - _3. Perform manual code review to identify technical debt and integration points._
     - _4. Establish basic CI/testing pipeline and begin adding tests where missing._
