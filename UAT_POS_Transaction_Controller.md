# UAT Test Scenarios: POS Transaction Controller
## Transaction Management System - User Acceptance Testing

---

## **📋 Overview**

This UAT document covers the core transaction processing workflows for POS terminal transactions including submission, validation, retry mechanisms, and void operations.

**Target System:** `API\V1\TransactionController`  
**Test Environment:** Staging  
**Prerequisites:** Active POS terminals, valid tenant configurations, test transaction data

---

## **🎯 UAT Scenarios**

### **UAT-001: Single Transaction Submission (Happy Path)**

**Objective:** Verify successful submission and processing of a single POS transaction

**Test Data:**
- Valid POS Terminal with active status
- Valid tenant and customer code
- Valid transaction payload with proper checksum

**Steps:**
1. **Given** a POS terminal is active and properly configured
2. **When** submitting a single valid transaction via POST `/api/v1/transactions/submit`
3. **Then** the system should:
   - ✅ Accept the transaction with HTTP 200
   - ✅ Generate transaction ID if not provided
   - ✅ Queue transaction for processing (`ProcessTransactionJob`)
   - ✅ Return success response with transaction details
   - ✅ Log transaction acceptance to system logs

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Transaction queued for processing",
  "transaction_id": "TXN-20250812-001",
  "status": "queued"
}
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Transaction appears in transactions table with `VALID` status
- [ ] System log entry created with `OFFICIAL_TRANSACTION_INGESTION` type
- [ ] Terminal notification sent if callback URL configured
- [ ] No duplicate transaction created for same transaction_id

### **UAT-002: Batch Transaction Processing**

**Objective:** Verify successful processing of multiple transactions in a single batch

**Test Data:**
- Batch payload with 5 valid transactions

- Valid batch checksum

**Steps:**
1. **Given** a POS terminal can accept batch transactions
2. **When** submitting batch via POST `/api/v1/transactions/official/batch`
3. **Then** the system should:
   - ✅ Validate batch structure and count
   - ✅ Process each transaction individually
   - ✅ Return batch results with success/failure counts
   - ✅ Handle partial batch failures gracefully

**Expected Batch Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "processed_count": 4,
  "failed_count": 1,
  "checksum_validation": "passed",
  "transactions": [...]
}
```

### **UAT-004: Transaction Void Operations**

**Objective:** Verify POS terminals can successfully void their own transactions

**Test Data:**

- Valid void reason
- Proper authentication token

**Steps:**
1. **Given** a processed transaction exists in the system
2. **When** POS terminal calls PUT `/api/v1/transactions/{id}/void` 
3. **Then** the system should:
   - ✅ Authenticate terminal ownership of transaction
   - ✅ Validate void request format and checksum
   - ✅ Update transaction with void information
   - ✅ Forward void to webapp if applicable
   - ✅ Return successful void confirmation

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Transaction voided successfully by POS",
  "transaction_id": "TXN-20250812-001",
  "voided_at": "2025-08-12T10:30:15Z",
  "void_reason": "Customer requested refund"
}
```

## **📝 My Product Owner Assessment**

As your Product Owner, here are my key observations and recommendations for this UAT:

### **🎯 Strengths Identified:**
1. **Comprehensive transaction processing** with proper validation chains
2. **Robust retry mechanisms** with different strategies per error type  
3. **Strong security model** with terminal authentication and ownership validation
4. **Excellent error handling** with specific, actionable error messages
5. **Good separation of concerns** between validation, processing, and integration

### **⚠️ Risk Areas Requiring Attention:**
1. **Circuit breaker dependency** - ensure external service failures don't cascade
2. **Database transaction integrity** - critical for financial data consistency
3. **Queue system reliability** - single point of failure for async processing
4. **Checksum validation complexity** - needs thorough edge case testing
5. **Terminal token management** - expired tokens need graceful handling

### **📈 Success Metrics to Monitor:**
- Transaction success rate > 99.5%
- Average processing time < 1.5 seconds  
- Retry success rate > 80%
- Zero duplicate transactions created
- 100% audit trail coverage

This UAT framework ensures we validate both the happy path and edge cases while maintaining focus on business-critical workflows. Would you like me to elaborate on any specific test scenarios or create additional documentation?
